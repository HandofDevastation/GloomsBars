## How to work with Jason (the owner) — READ THIS
- **Non-developer.** He sets requirements + does in-game QA; Claude writes all code + research.
- **ONE instruction at a time** for testing; never batch QA steps.
- **Verify before claiming** — frame builds as hypotheses; never say it works until confirmed in-game.
- When something misbehaves, ask for the **BugSack error text FIRST** (WoW hides Lua errors).
- UI: **sliding switches** over checkboxes; **no native Blizzard UI** widgets; **pixel-perfect**
  to mocks. Jason's Figma numbers translate 1:1 into recipe values — ask for mockups; the
  figma-desktop MCP tools may allow reading values directly from his file.

## Project & environment
- WoW **Midnight 12.0.7** retail, Interface `120007`. Client at `/Applications/World of Warcraft/_retail_/`.
- Repo root = addon folder, symlinked to `…/Interface/AddOns/GloomsBars`. BugSack installed.
- GitHub: https://github.com/HandofDevastation/GloomsBars (public). Releases: tag push →
  BigWigs packager workflow → GitHub Release → WoWUp installs/updates via repo URL.
  Shipped: v0.0.1, v0.1.0, v0.2.0 (pipeline + zip contents verified). `gh` CLI authorized
  on Jason's machine (account `polaris1976`, scopes repo/workflow/read:org).
- Blizzard UI source for hook research: wow-ui-source `live` branch — clone matched the
  client exactly (commit "12.0.7 (68453)"). Re-clone when the client patches.
- Siblings (read-only reference): GloomsAuras at `/Users/jasonstone/GloomsAuras` (config
  toolkit `Config.lua`, API-NOTES pattern, design tokens), Build Barn at
  `/Users/jasonstone/Desktop/glooms-build-barn` (release recipe).
- Jason's client addon ecosystem (QA context): ArcUI (bars/CDM UI), EnhanceQoL (border
  hiding was ON during early probes — now off), StoneTweaks, VibeOverlay, Platynator
  (nameplates; ships the Lato font), BugSack. Dominos' hotkey styler was found styling
  keybind text — Jason REMOVED it. Late-phase QA: coexistence re-test with these enabled.

## The core idea (do NOT relitigate)
Pure appearance layer over Blizzard's own action buttons. Never replace secure buttons;
never read secret combat values; react to Blizzard's events and restyle Blizzard's
rendered output. Edit Mode owns geometry (the clickable areas). Full rationale: [SPEC.md](SPEC.md).

**Settled decisions (2026-07-18, with Jason — do not reopen):** pure skin v1 (no secure-frame
geometry); bars 1–8 (pet/stance/extra later); standalone (no Masque); slash `/gb` (+
`/gloomsbars`), SavedVariables `GloomsBarsDB`, namespace `GB` → `_G.GloomsBars`.

## ★★ NORTH STAR (Jason, 2026-07-18): USER-AUTHORED styles via a style editor
Jason: "I wanted to build this via the UI myself — not a baked-in recipe. Define the
height and width of the icons (via the UI), overlay a gradient and position it, decide
where the keybind shows up, apply a shape to the overall construction… I want a TON of
flexibility — it's the entire point."
- A button style = **data** (shape, zoom, construction zones, decoration layers, text
  elements with position/font/size/color). The engine (Skin.lua decor pass) interprets
  data; `GB.STYLES` in code is scaffolding/starter-templates ONLY. Real styles live in
  SavedVariables, authored through the **style editor** (the Config UI — next major build).
- Reference look (matched in-game, Jason: "pretty cool"): `plate` — button extends ~40%
  below the icon, orange gradient fades in over the icon's bottom half, solid through the
  extension, keybind bold white centered in the extension, one continuous rounded shape.
- Icon sizing scope: the VISIBLE construction is freely sizable/aspectable (textures are
  not protected). The CLICKABLE hit area is the secure button — Edit-Mode-sized unless the
  spec's §B out-of-combat geometry fork is taken later. The UI must communicate this.

## CURRENT STATE — what's built and QA'd (all verified in-game 2026-07-18)
Files: `Core.lua` (namespace, tokens, `GB.SHAPES`, `GB.STYLES`, saved vars, `/gb` router,
probes), `Skin.lua` (skin + decoration engine), `Glows.lua` (proc glow engine),
`Media/masks|art/` (generated), `tools/generate-art.py` (SDF art generator).

- **Skin engine** (`/gb skin`, persisted): all 8 bars (96 buttons) — icon zoom crop
  (0.08), fresh per-button shape mask, slot art suppressed (`SlotBackground`/`SlotArt`
  Hide + `NormalTexture`/`PushedTexture` SetAlpha(0) — survives press), re-asserted via
  per-button `UpdateButtonArt` hook. ✅ QA'd incl. press cycles.
- **Shape registry** (`GB.SHAPES`: circle, roundrect, square; `/gb shape`, /reload to
  apply): every shape = mask/swipe/ring/glow PNGs from `tools/generate-art.py` (adding a
  shape = one signed-distance function). ✅ QA'd on all three shapes.
- **Cooldown sweeps**: circular 0.8-alpha swipe texture on `cooldown` + LoC widgets
  (charge cooldown untouched — edge-only), edge/bling off, re-anchored to the icon with
  overshoot (default 0.75px, `/gb sweep <px>`, persisted). ✅ QA'd.
- **State art**: hover/checked/flash replaced with `<shape>-ring` art (gold/blue/red
  tints). ✅ Hover QA'd. 📌 Jason: dimmer than default — styling controls required (backlog).
- **Proc glows — THE DIFFERENTIATOR, PROVEN**: `Glows.lua` hooks
  `ActionButtonSpellAlertManager:ShowAlert/HideAlert` + `AssistedCombatManager:
  SetAssistedHighlightFrameShown`; silences Blizzard frames via durable alpha-0; one
  shaped additive pulsing halo per button (gold procs / blue assist). ✅ QA'd: real
  in-combat proc traced the shape on round AND square. Assist-highlight replacement also
  observed working (LOW PRIORITY per Jason — do not iterate on it). 📌 "Hard to see" →
  intensity/styling controls in the editor.
- **Cast/channel overlay**: drain (`CastFill` mask swap), inner glow (art replacement via
  `PlaySpellCastAnim` hook, lime/gold, RING_FIT sizing), `EndBurst` end flash (mask
  swap). ✅ FULLY QA'd on round and square.
- **Decoration engine + construction zones** (`/gb style`, live, persisted): styles as
  data — extension zone below the icon, pooled WHITE8X8 gradient plates (solid+fade
  primitives), keybind override (position/font/size/color, re-asserted via `UpdateHotkeys`
  hook, text container raised). ✅ QA'd against Jason's Figma mock.
- **Text**: Count/Name/HotKey on bundled GeneralSans (sizes/flags/range-coloring kept).
  ✅ Verified via `/gb fontinfo`. Jason finds GeneralSans bland → font picker later, try Khand.

**Dev slash commands** (scaffolding, not product): `/gb skin`, `/gb shape <name>`,
`/gb style <name>`, `/gb sweep <px>`, `/gb debug`, `/gb glowinfo`, `/gb fontinfo`,
`/gb mask`, `/gb maskinfo`, `/gb round`.

## Verification gates
| # | Claim | Status |
|---|-------|--------|
| 1 | 8 bars' button globals = Dragonflight-era names, 12 each | ✅ VERIFIED |
| 2 | Subregions `.icon/.HotKey/.Name/.Count/.cooldown` (+anatomy in API-NOTES §1) | ✅ VERIFIED |
| 3 | MaskTexture renders in Midnight (with the fresh-mask + edge-padding rules, API-NOTES §2) | ✅ VERIFIED |
| 4 | `IsActionInRange`/`IsUsableAction` readable in Midnight combat (custom range tint) | ⚠ UNVERIFIED — not needed so far; Blizzard's own indicators kept working |
| 5 | Blizzard hook points (UpdateButtonArt, alert manager, cast anim, hotkeys…) | ✅ SOURCE-VERIFIED @ exact client build + confirmed in-game via the working hooks (API-NOTES §3) |
| 6 | Proc glows hookable without secret reads | ✅ VERIFIED IN COMBAT — the differentiator is proven |

## Hard-won LEARNINGS (verified — do NOT rediscover; details in API-NOTES)
- **Masks**: fresh masks render; editing a live mask's texture never re-renders; runtime
  attach silently fails on never-rendered never-masked textures (→ replace art instead);
  3-mask-per-texture cap; masks don't clip `SetColorTexture` fills (use WHITE8X8);
  ALL mask/glow art needs transparent edge padding (edge-clamp bleed flattens+blurs);
  `CircleMaskScalable` is NOT usable at button size (scalable/9-slice flattening).
- **Re-assertion map**: `UpdateButtonArt` = only slot-art re-shower (hook it); press
  border re-show is C-side (SetAlpha(0), never Hide); icon texcoord never stomped;
  vertex color stomped by `UpdateUsable` (leave it — Blizzard's usability tint);
  `UpdateHotkeys` re-anchors keybind text (hook it); cooldown swipe textures never re-set.
- **Glow systems**: THREE mechanisms (spell alerts / assisted highlight / rotation
  helper) — all hooked centrally; per-button alert frames, never pooled; assist ants
  flipbook only animates in combat.
- Zoom-crop icons (~0.08) before masking (baked borders at shape tangents).
- Error inside a slash handler leaves typed text undigested in the chat box (check BugSack).
- From siblings: secret-values model (GloomsAuras API-NOTES), release pipeline (Build
  Barn), bundled-font pre-warm (GloomsAuras Core.lua).

## ▶▶ NEXT: THE STYLE EDITOR (Config UI) — the product
1. Ask Jason for editor-UI mockups (Figma) before building layout.
2. Recipes → SavedVariables (user documents); `GB.STYLES` shrinks to starter templates.
3. Editor controls: construction/extension size, gradient layers (color/position/fade
   stops — think in solid+fade primitives), keybind placement + font/size/color, shape,
   visible-icon sizing, glow styling (tint/intensity/pulse/width), state-glow styling,
   sweep overshoot, per-bar enables.
4. Toolkit port from GloomsAuras `Config.lua` (design tokens + fonts already in Core.lua).
5. Config UI backlog (every dev slash-knob becomes a control): skin toggle, shape picker
   (later per-bar), sweep overshoot, state-glow color/opacity/intensity, text controls
   (hotkey font picker — try Khand), glow styling, profiles.

## Smaller anytime-items
- Aspect-correct mask art for stretched constructions (corner distortion on tall shapes).
- Count/Name per-style overrides; more layer kinds (border, badge, top plate).
- Pet/stance/extra-action/vehicle bars; minimap button + icon art (`## IconTexture`).
- WoWup install test on a second machine (NOT Jason's — would clobber the dev symlink).
- Late-phase: coexistence QA with ArcUI/EQOL re-enabled; `.pkgmeta` externals when libs arrive.
